Problem Set #2 Questions 
Written By: EJ Rainville, Spring 2021

1. How would you use dot to implement two_norm?


2. What is the formula that we would use for indexing if we wanted “slab-major” ordering? Hint: What is the size of a slab? It might be helpful to draw a picture of the data in 3D and see what the size is of a slab.

3. (Extra credit.) I claim that there are six distinct indexing formulas. Show that this claim is correct or that it is incorrect.
