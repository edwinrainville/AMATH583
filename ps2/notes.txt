Notes for Problem Set #2

1. The assertion that prints Hello World is assert1.exe, this is because NDEBUG is defined before the <cassert> package is applied therefore the assertion 
is not caught.


Exercises: 
5.1: Added -DNDEBUG to assert3.exe makefile rule so the assertion is not triggered.

5.2: Hello World!
    Added hello_world.cpp file to directory and it outputs "I am 3.2 kilometers from Lewis Hall"
